# Introduction

This is a project that attempts the Kaggle 'Histopathologic Cancer Detection' competition, which was a competition to create an algorithm that identifies metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger pathology scans.

The competition ran from Nov 16 2018 to Mar 31 2019, and it's available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection).

For this project, we'll be utilizing a CNN Architecture and working to build a model that can detect cancerous images with a high degree of certainty.

This Jupyter Notebook was run on Google Colab, and fetched the dataset directly from Kaggle. You may need to create an account on Kaggle and generate your personal API key to run this.
